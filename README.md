The file listed as "fs.f90" is the whole code, its not much, its made in nano and compiled with gfortran, and yes, I know it could be optimised but well, I will get to that soon.
It started with me wanting to make small programs in Fortran, and I found it annoying to make new programs everytime I wanted to make something, so I after a while I put them all in one program, and after not too long, it became this.
